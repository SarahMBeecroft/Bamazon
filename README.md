# Bamazon
Amazon-like storefront that runs on command line with Node and connects to MySQL 

## Overview
This app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. Additionally, this app contains some manager functionality including the ability to view low inventory and add to stock. 

## How to use

### Customer

Just type in 'node bamazonCustomer.js' in the command line to view the storefront. Then you will receive prompts to enter the ID of the item you would like to purchase, in addition to how many. 

Once you answer these prompts, you will receive a total price and be given the option to purchase more items. 

### Manager

Just type in 'node bamazonManager.js' in the command line to view a list of prompts including: 'View Products for Sale', 'View Low Inventory', and 'Add to Inventory.' 

*'View Products for Sale' will display a full list of inventory. 

*'View Low Inventory' will display any items with an inventory of 500 or less. 

*'Add to Inventory' will let you view current inventory and add to it. 

Still working on additional functionality for manager!
